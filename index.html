            Here are some of the projects I have done so far in my web development journey:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><h3><a href="./public/movie-ranking.html" draggable="true">Movie Ranking Project</a></li></h3>
            
            <p>
                It was my first web development project in which I show cased my 3 all time favourite movies through a website. 
                It was fully build on HTML and it was a great fun in creating this kinda website.
                When you click on the screenshot you will be redirected to that website.
            </p>
            <h3></h3>
            <hr>
            
            <a href="./public/movie-ranking.html"><img src="./assets/images/movie.png" /></a>
            
            <h3></h3>
            <hr>
            
            <h3><li><a href="./public/birthday-invite.html" draggable="true">Birthday Invitation Site</a></li></h3>
            
            <p>
                It was my second web development project.
                I prepared a website in which I created the invitation for my birthday.
                It was fully build on HTML only. It was a great fun in creating such a site.
                When you click on the screenshot you will be redirected to that website.
